GeMSE simulation for testing branching ratios
======
Simulation to check the branching ratio of gamma lines that are implemented in Geant4

## Usage
* You can run the simulation by
```
GeMSE_BR_test -m <macrofile.mac>
```

## Output
For every isotope there will be a txt file containing the branching ratio that is implemented in Geant4

## macrofile.mac
* contains the information which isotopes are simulated see e.g. macros/cosmogenics_BR.mac
